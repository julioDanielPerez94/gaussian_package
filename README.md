# Motivation
This is one package that I have created just to practice a bit of Object Oriented Programming and the first package that I upload to Pypi.

# Gaussian package

In this repo you will find a simple package that includes some methods and classes which allow you to solve mean, standard deviation and a bit more of a sample.

## Files in this repository
- Files needed by defect to upload to Pypi repository.
- Python scripts with classes and methods

## Installation and packages
You will not need to install any new module. You just need to copy the following lines to import the package and run it. If you want to know about the methods, please check .py files:
``` 
import distributions_julio_ml as db
a=db.Gaussian()
a
```

## Results
The results are the package itself. It's working nicely. 
## Issues
Nothing to comment here.
